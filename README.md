Nucleus detection and segmentation are the core operations in digital pathology and microscopy image analysis for the
study of cell morphology. In diagnosis process, pathological examinations make principal and critical contribution to medical protocols
and prognostic assessments. The automation of nucleus detection and segmentation with advancement of computer hardware design
and software released pathologistâ€™s manual labor and provided more robust and efficient analysis methods in clinical application and
pathological research. The state-of-art methods in deep learning lead more promising sophistication of methodology in this area. In this
paper, we implemented a U-net convolutional neural network architecture with data augmentation and drop out techniques.
